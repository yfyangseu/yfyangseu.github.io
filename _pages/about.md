I'm a Ph.D. Student in Computer Science and Engineering, fortunately advised by Prof. [DeLiang Wang](https://u.osu.edu/dwang/), in the [Perception and Neurodynamics Laboratory (PNL)](https://u.osu.edu/pnlab/) at The Ohio State University. I received my M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Institute of Technology and my B.E. in Information Engineering from Southeast University.

My current research interests are automatic speech recognition, speech separation, and self-supervised learning.
